""" 
Main Game Loop

1) Roll dice to see who goes first, usually highest first.

2) Each player puts their ante into the pot.

3) A point is obtained for rolling a 7 or 11. 

4) Penalties are paid for rolling a 2, 3, or 12 (craps). 

5) Two points wins the pot, given the second point survives the challenge round (see Rule 9).

6) Rolling a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 (the numbers) is inconsequential, nothing happens, except when rolling doubles (See Rule 8: Rolling doubles, gives a re-roll). 

7) The penalty for rolling a 2 or a 12 is to match the ante into the pot. The penalty for rolling a 3 is to put half the ante into the pot. 

8) Rolling doubles, gives a re-roll. Rolling three doubles in a row eliminates the player from that game. 

9) When a player acquires the second point, the game continues for one more round. If any of the other players roll a 7 or 11 they do not receive a point. Their 7 or 11 is used to cancel the second point of the player set to win the game. If a playerâ€™s second point gets cancelled, the dice go back to the player that the point got cancelled from and the game continues, i.e., the only way to win the pot is to acquire two points and be able to keep the second point through this last round challenge.
